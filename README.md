#instasound
==========

Do you get bored of listening to your own music all day e'ery day? Want to bring some variety and spontanuity to your listening? Well maybe instasound is for you. Using InstaSound you can listen to music from a variety of sources currently including 8tracks and Soundcloud with planned support for Rdio and Grooveshark in the future. I built this because I wanted something like it, but I want to hear what you would like from InstaSound, too. So shoot me an email at steinbach.rj@gmail.com with any feature requests.

##Usage:
simply clone or fork the repository, run pip install soundcloud, then pip install -r requirements.txt, and finally execute the get_tracks.py file.
```
python get_tracks.py
```
####Note: VLC must be installed for the program to work.
